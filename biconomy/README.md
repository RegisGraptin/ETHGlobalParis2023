# Biconomy implementation for Flora
We are using 2 methods from Biconomy to help the farmers get into the crypto space
## Web2 Auth
With the social web2 auth, the new users don't need to posses any web3 knowledge. They can easily create a new EOA account by using Biconomy SDK to onboard themselves for web3. 
## Gasless transaction
We do not want to force the new users to learn blockchain technology, that is what Biconomy is responsible for, to hide all the web3 aspects in order to accomplish flawless & gasless transactions. The lending functions are covered by a Biconomy paymaster.
